# Create a Jira Bug in LPD

Create a bug ticket in the LPD Jira project through the REST API.

## Input

When `${ARGUMENTS}` is a commit hash, inspect the commit with `git show` to understand the fix and infer the bug it addresses. When `${ARGUMENTS}` is a free-form description, use it directly.

## Gather Information

Request any missing details from the user:

- **Summary** — short title describing the bug.
- **Steps to Reproduce** — clear, minimal steps.
- **Expected Behavior** — what should have happened.
- **Actual Behavior** — what happened instead.

## Required Fields

The LPD project requires the following fields. Apply these defaults unless the user specifies otherwise:

- **Affects Version**: `Master` (ID: `16660`).
- **Component**: Select from the list below, or infer from the code area. Common components include:
	- `Content Publishing > Resource Importer` (ID: `15805`)
	- `Data Integration > Export/Import` (ID: `16131`)
	- `Headless Batch Engine API` (ID: `16022`)
- **Cross Cutting Properties** (`customfield_10979`): `None` (ID: `14468`).

When no listed component matches, fetch the LPD project components and pick the one whose name matches the keyword.

## Create the Ticket

Create the issue in the LPD project with the gathered summary, description, and required fields. Author the description in Atlassian Document Format (ADF) with the following sections, in order: Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Behavior, Actual Behavior. Append a Fix section when a commit is referenced.

## Output

The ticket key and the browse URL: `https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/<KEY>`.
