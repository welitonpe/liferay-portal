# Resets the "One" site in place, without touching Docker, the database, or the
# other client extensions. It tears down the seeded records, deletes the site
# group, redeploys just the site initializer client extension (which recreates
# and re-initializes the site), then reseeds the data and rebinds the virtual
# host. This is the lightest of the three resets: because it leaves the database
# and every other client extension alone, it is far faster than an instance or
# environment reset and keeps the local-dev OAuth2 application intact. Use it
# when only the site content or the seeded records are stale.
#
# Like bootstrap.sh, it pins the seed and teardown scripts to admin basic auth
# against localhost, so it never depends on the local-dev OAuth2 application and
# is never redirected at the remote environment the workspace .env may describe.
