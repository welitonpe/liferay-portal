# Re-provision the liferay-one-etc-spring-boot OAuth applications so their
# redirect URIs pick up virtual hosts that were bound after the client extension
# was first deployed, and restart the Spring Boot sidecar so it re-reads the
# refreshed route configuration.
#
# The user-agent application (liferay-one-etc-spring-boot-oaua) derives its
# redirect URIs from the company's virtual hosts at provision time, in
# OAuth2ProviderApplicationUserAgentConfigurationFactory.doActivate. The hostname
# is captured literally there -- only the protocol and port are interpolated at
# runtime -- so a host bound afterward never appears in the stored redirect URIs.
# During bootstrap the client extension is provisioned before set_virtual_hosts.sh
# binds one.localhost to the One site, so the application is created with only the
# localhost redirect URI. Browsing the site at its domain root then fails the
# SPA's Liferay.OAuth2.FromUserAgentApplication lookup with "No redirectURI
# matching origin http://one.localhost:8080".
#
# Redeploying the client extension re-fires the configuration factories, which
# re-read getVirtualHosts(companyId) -- now including one.localhost -- update the
# applications' redirect URIs in place through the service layer (the client id
# and secret are reused), and rewrite the OAuth route files on the shared routes
# volume. --rerun-tasks is required: without it Gradle treats
# createClientExtensionConfig as up to date and reuses the previous build
# timestamp, the redeployed config is byte-identical, and the config bundle
# tracker never re-activates the factories.
#
# The Spring Boot sidecar builds its OAuth client registrations once, from the
# route files, at startup -- wait-for-routes.sh only gates on the DXP route, not
# on the etc-spring-boot routes, so a sidecar that started before its routes were
# written comes up without the liferay-one-etc-spring-boot-oahs registration and
# every server-to-server call fails with "Could not find ClientRegistration".
# docker compose up --detach is a no-op when the image is unchanged, so restart
# the sidecar explicitly here to force it to re-read the routes.
#
# Run this after set_virtual_hosts.sh from every orchestrator that binds a
# virtual host: bootstrap.sh, instance_reset.sh, and site_reset.sh.
