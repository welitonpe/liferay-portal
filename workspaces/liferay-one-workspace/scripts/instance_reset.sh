# Resets the Liferay virtual instance's data in place, entirely through the
# Liferay APIs and client-extension redeploys. It never touches Docker, the
# database, or the server process: it tears down everything the bootstrap seeds
# and provisions (both the seeded records and the structural scaffolding),
# deletes the "One" site, then reprovisions by redeploying the two data-bearing
# client extensions (the batch import and the site initializer) and reseeding.
#
# This is the middle reset tier, between /one-site-reset (site and records only)
# and /one-env-reset (a full Docker rebuild). Use it when the batch-owned
# scaffolding that /one-site-reset leaves in place -- object definitions,
# relationships, commerce configuration, roles, taxonomies -- needs to be
# rebuilt, but the image and bundle are still good.
#
# A literal "create a new company and delete the old one" is impossible for the
# default virtual instance: Liferay defines the default as the company whose
# webId matches the company.default.web.id property, refuses to delete it
# (RequiredCompanyException), and offers no runtime way to hand the default off
# to another company. So a clean instance is achieved by resetting the default
# company's data in place instead.
#
# Like bootstrap.sh, it pins the seed and teardown scripts to admin basic auth
# against localhost, so it never depends on the local-dev OAuth2 application and
# is never redirected at the remote environment the workspace .env may describe.
